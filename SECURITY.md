## Reporting a Vulnerability

Security vulnerabilities shouldn’t be reported publicly to prevent potential exploitation. Instead, please report any vulnerabilities privately by reaching out directly to us. You can either join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/UHrpNWGwkH) and send a direct message to a maintainer or contact us via email at contact@community-scripts.org. Be sure to include a detailed description of the vulnerability and the steps to reproduce it. Thank you for helping us keep our project secure!

Once a vulnerability has been reported, the project maintainers will review it and acknowledge the report within 7 business days. We will then work to address the vulnerability and provide a fix as soon as possible. Depending on the severity of the issue, a patch may be released immediately or included in the next scheduled update.

Please note that not all reported vulnerabilities may be accepted. The project maintainers reserve the right to decline a vulnerability report if it is deemed to be a low-risk issue or if it conflicts with the project's design or architecture. In such cases, we will provide an explanation for the decision.

If you have any questions or concerns about this security policy, please don't hesitate to contact the project maintainers.
