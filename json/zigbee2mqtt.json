    "description": "Zigbee2MQTT is an open-source software project that allows you to use Zigbee-based smart home devices (such as those sold under the Philips Hue and Ikea Tradfri brands) with MQTT-based home automation systems, like Home Assistant, Node-RED, and others. The software acts as a bridge between your Zigbee devices and MQTT, allowing you to control and monitor these devices from your home automation system.",
