    "description": "Blocky is a software tool designed for blocking unwanted ads and trackers on local networks. It functions as a DNS proxy and runs on the Go programming language. Blocky intercepts requests to advertisements and other unwanted content and blocks them before they reach the end user. This results in a cleaner, faster, and more secure online experience for users connected to the local network. Blocky is open-source, easy to configure and can be run on a variety of devices, making it a versatile solution for small to medium-sized local networks.",
