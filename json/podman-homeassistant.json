    "description": "A standalone Podman container-based installation of Home Assistant Core means that the Home Assistant Core software is installed inside a container managed by Podman, separate from the host operating system. This provides a flexible and scalable solution for running the software, as the container can be easily moved between host systems or isolated from other processes for security. Podman is a popular open-source tool for managing containers that is similar to Docker, but designed for use on Linux systems without a daemon.\r\n\r\n\ud83d\udec8 If the LXC is created Privileged, the script will automatically set up USB passthrough.",
