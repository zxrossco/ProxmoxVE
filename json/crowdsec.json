    "description": "CrowdSec is a free and open-source intrusion prevention system (IPS) designed to provide network security against malicious traffic. It is a collaborative IPS that analyzes behaviors and responses to attacks by sharing signals across a community of users. CrowdSec leverages the collective intelligence of its users to detect and respond to security threats in real-time. With CrowdSec, network administrators can set up protection against a wide range of threats, including malicious traffic, bots, and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. The software is designed to be easy to use and integrate with existing security systems, making it a valuable tool for enhancing the security of any network.",
